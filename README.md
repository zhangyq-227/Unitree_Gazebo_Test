# Uniteree_Gazebo_Test

The repository provides a Gazebo simulation environment for testing robotic reinforcement learning algorithms, implemented using ROS Noetic and the LibTorch library. It also supports the simulation of RealSense depth images in Gazebo to validate vision-based algorithm deployment and minimize the sim-to-real gap.
